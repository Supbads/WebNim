Implementation of a mathematical turn based strategy game [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).
Recently replaying the [game](www.transience.com.au/pearl3.html) from my childhood memories made me try a similar implementation.
In short, 2 players take turns removing objects from rows. The objective is to force the other person into picking the last object.
